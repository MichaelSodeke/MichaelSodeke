## ABOUT ME 
My name is Michael Sodeke. I am a Mathematics major specializing in *Computational Mathematics*, graduating in 2022.
I am seeking employment as a *Linux System Administrator*. In addition, my
future goal is to work as a *Quant Developer*.

In 2020 I paid for and enrolled in Andrew Ng’s **Stanford** *Machine Learning Certification program*, where
I learned how to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression,
logistic regression, and neural networks, as well as anomaly detection. The course revealed how essential
mathematics was in this field. This experience further developed my interest in modeling complex systems:
social, economic, biological, financial, etc. However, I was still confused about whether or not
*Data Science* and *Machine Learning* were separate fields.

Later on, I learned about the *Data Science pipeline* and its implementation through the **Johns Hopkins 
University** *Data Science Certification program*. I also discovered that Machine Learning, referred to as
*Predictive Analysis*, was part of the Data Science pipeline. Unfortunately, the instructors decided to use
pre-made algorithms from ML libraries instead of showing how to build these same algorithms from scratch using
math formulas to teach the course. Thus, I searched online for PDF documents from Dartmouth, Stanford, and MIT
about ML algorithms and how to construct them with math formulas. I was successful in my efforts and later on
passed the course.

Also, in 2020, I interned as a *Sector Analyst* for the **Davis Investment Group**, where I was assigned to
keep track of certain stocks held by the firm. Paying close attention to economic sectors, and how they
affected each other, was essential.

In addition, I participated in *Carnegie Mellon University’s* 2021 **PicoCTF** network security competition
this Spring. The competition was a great way for me to improve my programming and ethical hacking skills.
Unfortunately, I did not complete all the problems, but I am preparing for the next competition this Fall.
