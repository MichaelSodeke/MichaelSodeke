<!--about me-->
<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p align="left", style="color:red;">
    I am a Maths major specializing in Computational Maths, graduating in 2023.
    My initial goal is to work as an <b>Investment Banking Analyst</b> for a few years at a bulge bracket bank, then later work my way
    up to <b>Managing Director</b> at the same bank.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Financial Interest</h3>
<p align="left", style="color:gray;">
    My goal working as an Investment Banker is to gain experience learning how to raise capital for companies and governments, as 
    well as learning how to advise them on ways they can meet their financial needs. Also, my initial plan is to create a tech start-up
    based on developing hardware and software for IoT devices. The experiences gained working as an Investment
    Banker will assist me well when managing my firm's financial affairs.
</p>

<p align="left", style="color:gray;">
    In addition, my interest in capital markets involve developing financial literacy on how the exchangement of funds and currencies help
    create value in a society and its economy. Events, such as Nixon taking the U.S. off the Bretton-Woods system, the 2008 stock market and housing
    crash, the 2010 flash crash, or the recent COVID-19 pandemic, illustrate the importance of being financially literate
    during financial and economic crises. With such literacy I'll be able to <b>secure</b> my finances, <b>retain</b> my financial mobility,
    and <b>increase</b> my socio-economic status.
