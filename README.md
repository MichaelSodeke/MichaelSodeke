<!--about me-->
<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p align="left">
    My name is Michael Šòdéké. I am a Mathematics major specializing in Computational Mathematics, graduating in 202X.
    My future goal is to work as an Investment Banker for three years at a bulge bracket bank, then later work for an
    additional three years as a Quantitative Trader at the same bank.

    What attracts me to Investment Banking would be raising capital for companies and
    governments, as well as advising them on how they can meet their financial challenges.
    I plan on creating my own tech start-up based on developing hardware and software for
    IoT devices. The experiences I gain from working as an Investment Banker will assist
    me well when managing my firm's financial affairs.

    In addition, what attracts me to finance, in general, is the exchangement of funds and
    currencies that create value in a society and its economy. My position is that events, such
    as Nixon taking the U.S. off the Bretton-Woods system, the 2008 stock market and housing
    crash, the 2010 flash crash, or the recent COVID-19 pandemic, illustrate the importance of
    being financially literate during financial and economic crises. Having such literacy
    ensures that I will be secure and retain financial mobility.
