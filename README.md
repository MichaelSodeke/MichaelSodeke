## ABOUT ME 
My name is Michael Sodeke. I am a Mathematics major specializing in *Computational Mathematics*, graduating in 2022.
My interests are in *Computer Science* and *Investment Banking*, and my future goal is to work as a *Quant Developer*.

In 2020 I paid for and enrolled in Andrew Ng’s **Stanford** *Machine Learning Certification program*, where
I learned how to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as linear
regression, logistic regression and neural networks, as well as anomaly detection. The course was difficult
and revealed how essential mathematics was in this field. This experience further developed my interest in
modeling complex systems: social, economic, biological, financial, etc. However, I was still confused about
whether or not *Data Science* and *Machine Learning* were separate fields.

Later on, I learned about the *Data Science pipeline* and its implementation through the **Johns Hopkins
University** *Data Science Certification program*. Throughout this program, I discovered that Machine
Learning was part of the pipeline, referred to as *Predictive Analysis*. Unfortunately, the instructors decided
to use pre-made algorithms from ML libraries instead of showing how to build these same algorithms from
scratch using math formulas in order to teach the course. Thus, I had to do extra work by searching online
for PDF documents from Dartmouth, Stanford and MIT on how to build ML algorithms with math formulas.
I was successful and later on passed the course.

Also in 2020, I interned as a *Sector Analyst* for the **Davis Investment Group** where I was assigned to
keep track of certain stocks held by the firm. Paying close attention to news surrounding key economic
sectors, and how they affected each other, was essential.

In addition, I participated in *Carnegie Mellon University’s* 2021 **PicoCTF** network security competition
this Spring. The competition was a great way for me to improve my programming and ethical hacking skills.
Unfortunately, I did not complete all the problems, but I am preparing for the next competition this Fall.
